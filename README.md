# The Beatles challenge from Teladoc

iTunes search API allows you to find a bunch of information quickly and easily from Apple’s iTunes database as JSON response. With simple search terms and parameters, you can request all the albums by 1960’s international mega star rock band The Beatles! Write an application that will request the albums by The Beatles, parse the JSON and display all the album titles in a TableView / RecyclerView.

Extra credit: Include functionality that would allow someone to search their own favorite artist from the API and display the results.
